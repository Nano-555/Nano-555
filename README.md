ManageLegion aims to provide an easy way of installing mods for Watch Dogs Legion
by making the process of combining multiple mods together as uncomplicated as possible.

## How does it work?
Mods for installation with ManageLegion come as *.zip archives, each with a
mandatory "info.xml" file containing the mod's description, a list of features, images and more.

*See the Resources folder for more information on how to set up mod packages.*
